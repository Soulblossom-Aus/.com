      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The great mystical force that holds the universe together and sustains it efficiently has bestowed upon mankind the precious gift of life. This gift when unwrapped on a daily basis throws up surprises of joys and sorrows, ups and downs, occasionally sad moments and often even frolicking ones.

        These moment to moment surprising and uncertain gifts become a joy to experience and living becomes effortless if one is blessed with a true friend or companion. For us, Sanjay Sai Baba is this friend, companion and an omnipotent channel that is constantly showering His grace upon each one of us.

        All of 28 years ( as in January 2016 ), yet brimming with the divinity of the ancient knowledge of countless ages, Baba has shown the way to Dharma, be it through loving words, selfless acts or Godly thoughts. He has dedicated Himself to spiritual elevation of humanity by helping mankind to see God in each other.

        The essence of His teachings revolve around Truth, Righteousness, Peace, Love and Non-Violence and bringing these values to the fore; values which man seems to have forgotten.

        His divinity could not go un-noticed as his knowledge, miracles and immense love have drawn crowds from a very tender young age. Fondly referred to as Nepali Sai Baba, his devotees are only growing in numbers.

        The story of Bhagawan Shri Sanjay Sai Baba's advent in this world:<br>
        <br>

        This is the extraordinary story of the most divine Lord who descended on this earth to show mankind the path to ascend and reach God. To quote His own words, "I have taken birth to show you the purpose of your birth."

        In the Gorakhnath lineage in Kushalvansh was born Bhagawan Shri Sanjay Sai Baba as prophesised years ago. To Shri Santosh Kumar and the  pious Maiyya Devi who was absolutely devoted to Lord Vishnu was born  Baba. Once a Satya Narayana vratakathawas conducted. The first morsel of the sanctified Prasad was offered to mata Maiyya Devi. On partaking of the Prasad, mata  Maiyya Devi started having divine experiences. That very night Lord Satya Narayana Himself appeared in her dream and granted her boons in that vision that He would soon come to dwell in her sacred womb. The Lord then did 'pravesha' in the mother's womb. Thus we know that the lord was born from His own free will with pravesha (enter at will) and not prasava (conception).

        After this significant dream wondrous events started occurring in the house. Suddenly from nowhere the house would be filled with an aroma serene essence.The fragrance was heavenly. At night the lamp in the family altar would light up on its own. Musical instruments would start to play on their own accord. Sometimes the sounds of sacred mantras and holy chants filled the air. Grandparents and parents all started getting darshans and visions of lord Shiva or lord Narayana. Many such divine events preceded the birth of the lord.

         On the most auspicious day of AD 1989, January 19th, in the divine  muhurat was born on this earth our most beloved Baba. The aura of the infant was undeniably divine. Often mother would find the child's hands filled with vibhuti: sacred ash. Much later many were subjected to many divine miracles which led them to believe in the inherent divinity of Baba.

        What can one say about all of the limitless wondrous stories that abound around the divine lord? To describe them is impossible; to speak of them is like trying to hold the sunshine in your palm. Words may fail and finish but the glorious saga of the lord will continue for eons and ages. Thus at a young age Baba showed His divinity to all.</p>

Sairam, I am Garima, a formal student at Bhagwan Shree Sanjay Sai Baba's school and a member at SB Australia. It's been around 7 years and 1 year since I joined SB Australia. I think Soul Blossom classes are the most essential things for we teenagers and youths in this era because we lack the most important thing that gives us the essence of being human, spirituality and moral values.SB classes teaches us moral values such as 5 human values (Truth, Right-conduct, Peace, Love and Non-violence),  5D's Principle(Duty, Discipline, Devotion, Determination, Discrimination) along with different chanting and bhajans . This class works for the overall development of we youths and adolescent and makes us a human with dignity, values and spirituality .I personally  love this class. This class have not only taught me a  better way of life but gifted me a new family, my SB family. I want to express my heartily gratitude to Bhagwan Baba and my guru, Sanchita Amma for giving me a golden opportunity to participate in this class.</p>

        Om Shree sairam, my humble pranams at the divine lotus feet of Bhagwan Baba and my heartily sairam to all the devotees of our beloved swami.
I am Suweksha, a member of Soul Blossom Australia. I have been a member of SB Australia since last 3 years. As a formal member I have many experience. This class is the best part of my life. In Sb class we learn different life skills, moral lessons and  values. Most importantly we learn to recognize the spiritual being inside us. The classes are student friendly and follow fun based learning where we are not pressurized to learn but apart from learning we play some quiz and discuss our point of view in different topics. This class teaches us to be a dignified, moral and spiritual being by awakening us by teachings of bhagwan baba, the 5 human values( Truth , Right-conduct, Peace, Love and Non-Violence) 5D principle (Duty , Discipline, Determination, Devotion and Discrimination), chants and bhajans. This class has made me find best version of myself.
             So I would like to extend my heartily gratitude  to Bhagwan Baba for giving me such a platform and such a lovely family, My SB family..</p>

Om shree sairam
My humble pranam at the divine lotus feet of Bhagwan baba.
I am Rashu Karki, a student of soul blossom Australia

It doesn't matter when I joined and how long it has been but the thing that really matter is what I learned and how I transform my self after joing Australia soul blossom class

If I have to talk about my experience  of soul blossom Australia,  one thing come in my mind that is love with care and uniy

Soul blossom Australia is a place where  we can freely express our opinion as we get family environment there. We learn spiritual values along with human values by sharing our experience and listening to our guru, friends etc. Sometimes we talk about  the solution of our problems, we talk about different situation and at last we come to know that everybody have different opinion so difference in opinion doesn't mean others are wrong, that's only the way how we observe it.

We have realized that only learning is not enough but implementation after learning is important. In our soul blossom class we learn the lesson of forgiveness.

There are a lot of things to share about my experience in Australia soul blossom class but if I have to share it in short I would like to define it as a home where family members are united in need even if they argue on something as there is always love and care for each other even in such arguments.

How is it possible to have such a wonderful bonding like of family members among unknown people?

Yes, it is the miracle of our bhagwan baba, our guru, our mentor, who connects us from our heart.

Swami, please grant us the strength to follow tha path of truthfulness and love always🙏🙏

Aum shree sairam.</p>
